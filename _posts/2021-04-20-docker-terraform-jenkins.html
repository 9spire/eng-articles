<p class="preamble">Preamble: This might sound familiar - if it doesn't, no one wants to hear it smarty pants - I'm just now getting to ________ technology. In the world of development, I'm always a beginner at something and between us, that might be the hardest part and the most interesting part (that's what we're supposed to say, right?).</p>

<h2>I learned something today</h2>

<p><b>What:</b> Wrote a Dockerfile to make a containerized website someone else made (see todo #2 below), used Terraform to plan, apply, and launch to S3, incorporated the world's simplest Selenium-based unit and integration tests, and made a nod to using Jenkins for a deployment pipeline.</p>

<p><b>Why:</b> I'm using all of these tools and need a better idea of how they all work, their syntax, and how to update projects that use them, write original projects with them, etc. It's part of my job today, and I see it being important in the future.</p>

<p>If you build it, then you have at least some concept of how to build it again, build it better, and have a surface conversation about it. Just imagine how many people would cling to my every word at a cocktail party.... well, I guess it depends on the party. &#129299;</p>

<p><b>How:</b> I took a handly little course on LinkedIn with plenty of outdated dependencies, some command strings that I had to get help on, and even an .env file to keep my secrets secret. I went at least 15% out of my way to complete it so here's my brag article. BOOM!</p>

<p><b><i>What now?</i></b> Well, I'd like to combine this project with another project/tutorial/class to replace the "someone else's website" with something I've built and customized and finish up the parts that weren't included in the 2.5 hours total of video instruction.</p>

<h5>The Project</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Running on AWS S3: <a href="http://project.rdittmar.com.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/">http://project.rdittmar.com.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/</a> (be still my beating DNS)</li>
    <li>Link to the project on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/9spire/docker-project">https://github.com/9spire/docker-project</a></li>
</ul>

<h5>To Do</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Write the Jenkins scripts files to deploy from a Git push</li>
    <li>Update the "website" with something I've built</li>
    <li>Write some real tests, more tests, ALL OF THE TESTS!!!</li>
    <li>Chill out about tests...</li>
</ul>
