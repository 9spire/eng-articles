<h2>The job search</h2>
<h5>Hard truths</h5>

<hr class="center-diamond">

<p>As I look for my next job, I wanted to share the journey here in the hopes that it is, at best, helpful, and at the least, entertaining.</p>

<h5>Current Assessment</h5>

<p>Brass tacks, hard truth, my contract at Nike has an end date that is coming up. When that date comes, I will have worked at Nike for almost four years. Within those four years, I’ve worked two distinctly different positions, on two tech stacks, with two teams, and under seven different direct managers. </p>

<p>When the pandemic hit, I was interviewing for a full time position at Nike, basically interviewing for the job I held then, a job where I wrote the interview questions. While it wasn’t in the bag, per se, I like to think I had a good chance at landing that job. </p>

<p>Headcount was frozen, then cut, then cut again, the project was paused. Two weeks of lockdown turned into a year and that job was a distant memory like hugging casual friends or seeing someone’s smile in person.</p> 

<p>Here I am, with a hard end date on my contract and assurance from my contracting rep that I will not be continuing in any contractual capacity due to changing legalities. It’s time to start looking for a new job.</p>

<p>As much as I dislike “affirmations” this is apparently my current list.</p>
<ul>
    <li>I just need one “yes”. </li>
    <li>There is a job, company, and team that is right for me.</li>
</ul> 
<p></p>

<p>There’s a lot that goes into looking for a job. The tech industry is the one I know best, so bear with me if I say there’s a quality about tech work that’s more universally applicable. Tech is my universe and has been since 2006. </p>

<p>Breaking this down into general topics is the only way I can fathom covering this experience so here’s how I’m bucketing this today:</p>


<p><strong>The Unholy Tech Stack</strong><br/><span class="text-muted small italic">Who can know everything? (Except Joe. Which is okay, you’re awesome Joe)</span><br/>

<strong>Experience Conundrum </strong><br/><span class="text-muted small italic">
Doing something new. How you really get a job.</span><br/>

<strong>Perfection vs. Good Enough</strong><br/><span class="text-muted small italic">
Imposter Syndrome is that acquaintance who is trying to be helpful but is just eroding your confidence</span><br/>
