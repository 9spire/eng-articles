<h2>Basic is Best</h2>
<h5>When it's been 5 years since using Python</h5>

<p>I'd like to harken back to a Python project I worked on many years ago. Cast your mind on a much younger version of myself, idealistic and parallel parking a Ford F250 "Cowboy Cadillac" in downtown Portland to go to work at We Work (cringe here if you've seen <a href="https://www.hulu.com/movie/wework-or-the-making-and-breaking-of-a-47-billion-unicorn-c6deead3-f45f-43c6-b8bf-fc56e9f8a589?cmp=11932&utm_source=google&utm_medium=SEM&utm_campaign=CM_SEM_Various+Niche+Originals&utm_term=wework&gclsrc=aw.ds&&gclid=CjwKCAjwmv-DBhAMEiwA7xYrd0nKb_qusaf-89hH8Yh_UYIev5F4-C05gsan9KHPaktObbo7642lGBoCrC0QAvD_BwE" target="_blank">the documentary</a>).</p>

<p>I was working for Distinct Daily Media and every day was a new adventure in Python, Django, and the website I was building on top of all of that. Sadly, that website is no more. You may view the archeological version on the Wayback Machine: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160413074855/https://www.distinctdaily.com/" target="_blank">Distinct Daily</a>. There was daily use of Python then, but that was five years ago, and although it's a programming language and follows all of the same concepts as any others, I wanted to brush up in the shortest time possible.</p>
