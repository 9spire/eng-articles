<h2>The job search</h2>
<h5>Hard truths</h5>

<hr class="center-diamond">

As much as I dislike “affirmations” this is apparently my current list.
<ul>
    <li>I just need one “yes”. </li>
    <li>There is a job, company, and team that is right for me.</li>
</ul> 
<p></p>

<p>Brass tacks, hard truth, my contract at Nike has an end date that is coming up. When that date comes, I will have worked at Nike for almost four years. Within those four years, I’ve worked two distinctly different positions, on two tech stacks, with two teams, and under seven different direct managers. </p>

<p>When the pandemic hit, I was interviewing for a full time position at Nike, basically interviewing for the job I held then, a job where I wrote the interview questions. While it wasn’t in the bag, per se, I like to think I had a good chance at landing that job. </p>

<p>Headcount was frozen, then cut, then cut again, the project was paused. Two weeks of lockdown turned into a year and that job was a distant memory like hugging casual friends or seeing someone’s smile in person.</p> 

<p>Here I am, with a hard end date on my contract and assurance from my contracting rep that I will not be continuing in any contractual capacity due to changing legalities. It’s time to start looking for a new job.</p>

<p>There’s a lot that goes into looking for a job. The tech industry is the one I know best, so bear with me if I say there’s a quality about tech work that’s more universally applicable. Tech is my universe and has been since 2006. </p>

<p>Breaking this down into general topics is the only way I can fathom covering this experience so here’s how I’m bucketing this today:</p>

<h5>Thought inquiry exercise into interviewing</h5>
<span class="text-muted small italic">Applying Buddhist practices to interviews and seeing what comes up</span>

<p>Did a <a href="https://thework.com/" target="_blank">Byron Katie worksheet</a> this morning to explore my beliefs around interviews. I used a recent interview as <i>the</i> moment to imagine, so I can explore these beliefs fully. What the heck was happening during these interviews? I need new ways of approaching these experiences, this much I do know. Here's a short list of what is going on that I'd like to change:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Anticipating extremes, going great or total failure, it's disproportionate to the activity.</li>
    <li>Outcomes are far too personal, taken personally, and affecting my sense of value beyond the conversation.</li>
    <li>It's feeling like a survival-level activity.</li>
    <li>And so on...</li>
</ul>

<p>Why thought inquiry? What I'm thinking and beliving about the application and interview process is essentially negative and needs to shift in order for me to see it differently. Seeing it from new angles will free me to be fully present, to appreciate the experience, and to be engaged. That is the outcome I'm seeking by writing down 6 pages of materials while meditating on the questions and answers.</p>

<p>This is pretty raw stuff, so it's not easy to share this right now, especially knowing I'm going to post this article on LinkedIn as soon as I'm done writing it. In the interest of interviews-as-a-challenge being a shared experience (I am far from unique and fall into that "normal" human being category), I will attempt to share with as much candor as this moment allows.</p>

<p>Here we go...</p>

<p>This is where I started in the worksheet: "I am afraid that Bob (not his name) will not hire me, think I'm incompetent and/or don't know enough for this position. Bob should see my experience and value and hire me, instead of judging me."</p>

<hr class="center-diamond">
<p></p>

<img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/FourQuestions.png" alt="Four Questions">

<p></p>

<p>This is where this stuff gets really potent! Here's a breakdown of some of the ideas I put to the four quesitons:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Bob shouldn't think I'm incompetent or don't know enough.</li>
    <li>Bob should see my experience and value (and he doesn't).</li>
    <li>Bob should hire me.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here's how some of these turned out after I asked if it's true (pretty much always answered yes), and if I absolutely know that it's true (pretty much always answered no) and made it to the "how do I react" part (warning, this is raw stuff here....):</p>

<ul>
    <li>I react by being demanding, frustrated, despairing and offer up all of my experiences from that place of desperation.</li>
    <li>I spend all of my free time learning, adding certificates, and trying to sound smart instead of relying on the many years of experience I already have.</li>
    <li>I don't admit to what I don't know and get defensive and protective. I feel defeated (and sound that way). I stop trying. I'm no longer engaged.</li>
</ul>

<p>and when I get to the "if I couldn't believe the thoughts" part:</p>

<ul>
    <li>If I couldn't believe the thought, I'd be curious, asking questions, and interested in what Bob wants.</li>
    <li>If I couldn't believe the thought, I'd be calm and confident about what I have experienced  and what my value is. I'd also be confident in what I <i>haven't</i> experienced and what I don't know.</li>
    <li>If I couldn't believe the thought, I'd be looking forward to finding the right match. Excited to get the right job with the right team. I'd want to understand what Bob wants and be grateful for his time.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here's where I saw that I'm asking Bob to tell me what my value is. That approaching interviews from a place of panic isn't going to help me find that right job match. I even went as far as looking forward to feeling inadequate in an interview again so I can see where I need to relax more and what is truthfully coming up through this process.</p>


<p>Interviewing feels like, for most of us, asking another person to judge us on our quality and value. No wonder it's so anxiety provoking! After this exercise, however, I am feeling ready to discover what someone else is looking for in a candidate and seeing if we have parity as two people might work together to solve a problem. </p>
